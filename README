libirc
========
A Python module that allows you to connect to IRC in a simple way.
This module can work on both Python 2 and 3, however, you need to use Unicode
strings if you use Python 2.

Usage Example:
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import libirc
    import time

    my_irc_connection = libirc.IRCConnection()

    # Connect to the server and identify yourself
    my_irc_connection.connect(host, port)
    my_irc_connection.setnick(nickname)
    my_irc_connection.setuser(ident, realname)
    my_irc_connection.join(channel)

    # You can send messages
    my_irc_connection.say(channel, 'I am coming!')
    my_irc_connection.say(someone, 'I can send you a private message!')

    # Or keep receiving messages
    while my_irc_connection.sock: # Receiving loop
        response = my_irc_connection.parse(block=True)
        if response: # If nothing is received, response will be None
            pass     # Do your stuff here, e.g. if response.cmd=='PRIVMSG':

    # Non-blocking receiving
    while my_irc_connection.sock: # Receiving loop
        response = my_irc_connection.parse(block=False)
        if response: # If received something
            pass     # Do your stuff here, e.g. if response.cmd=='PRIVMSG':
        else:        # If nothing is received, response will be None
            time.sleep(2) # Wait a moment


    # Notice:

    # Libirc handles PING and CTCP PING automatically when you use parse().
    # parse() still returns the detail of that PING, but you do not need to
    # process it yourself.

    # You should call parse() at most every 4 minutes, or the server will
    # disconnect from you.

    # When libirc detects a network error, it will raise socket.error. If the
    # network connection is terminated, its errno should be errno.ENOTSOCK or
    # errno.EPIPE.

    # If you would like to receive raw stream from the server, use recvline(),
    # after that, you can still parse it, since parse() equals to
    # parse(line=recvline()).


    # Leave a channel or disconnect from server
    my_irc_connection.part(channel, 'I am leaving!')
    my_irc_connection.quit('Goodbye, server!')
